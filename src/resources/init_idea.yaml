init_idea:
  mission: >
    To design a unified, "living flow" where Nutrition, Exercise, Planning, Tracking, and etc. 
    are not separate apps, but integrated modules of a single organism. Every pillar must 
    be built using the same structural DNA to ensure that data flows perfectly through 
    the system as a unified "source of truth."
  
  technical_constraints:
    unified_structural_schema_api_first: >
      Every pillar must utilize the same data structure and communication protocols. 
      Integration must be implemented via API to ensure that a change in Pillar #1 
      is natively readable by Pillar #2 (and etc.) without translation layers.
    local_llm_and_hybrid_rag: >
      Intelligence must be designed for Local LLM execution. Grounding must use a 
      Hybrid RAG system: searching both local vector databases (for private user data) 
      and the live internet (for latest research/food data) to ensure zero-latency 
      and high-integrity responses.
    hardware_appendix: >
      New features (Bluetooth, Smartwatch, IoT, Vision, and etc.) are excluded 
      from this phase. They will be added as "Future Suggestions" for dispute 
      only after the core software logic is validated.

  suggestion_pillar_future_experimental:
    description: "Reserved for the 'Dispute' phase once the core software organism is established."
    topics:
      - connectivity: "Bluetooth, IoT, and etc."
      - wearables: "Smartwatches, Biometric sensors, and etc."
      - vision: "Computer vision for form analysis, AR, and etc."
      - experimental: "Any new or experimental technologies."

  required_output_format_for_planners:
    parent_mission: "A short summary of the mission to maintain context."
    proposed_pillars: "List the pillars/topics identified for the current phase (Nutrition, Exercise, Planning, Tracking, and etc.)."
    decomposition_and_recursive_rule: >
      For each pillar, define the parameters needed to divide the work into Small Doable Units (SDU). 
      Explicitly state which sub-topics within these parameters are still too large and require 
      a deeper execution by a child-agent.
    the_dispute_local_llm_and_rag: >
      Identify one critical reason why the Local LLM or the Hybrid RAG system (local vs. internet) 
      might fail or face bottlenecks for this specific pillar (e.g., search latency, 
      scraping accuracy, or local vector database synchronization).
    suggestion_pillar_updates: >
      Any specific hardware or experimental topics identified during the split 
      to be moved to the future suggestion list.
