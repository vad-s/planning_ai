  The fitness system is conceived as a fully personal, individual-centric 
  platform that unifies training, nutrition, habits, and wellbeing into 
  a seamless and coherent experience. It enables one person to track exercises,
  workouts, meals, food composition, hydration, sleep and body metrics 
  while receiving personalized insights and progression guidance derived entirely 
  from self-reported data. The core experience is built around text-based interaction, 
  structured data entry, adaptive recommendations, meaningful correlations, 
  and a holistic view of lifestyle and performance. From the start, its architecture 
  anticipates future privacy, compliance, and security frameworks, allowing the system 
  to evolve into a fully regulated, secure, and consent-driven personal health environment. 
  
  In the initial phase, the system intentionally excludes smartwatches, sensors, video capture,
  computer vision, IoT equipment, and any visual helper technologies. 
  Privacy-and-compliance modules, as well as advanced security layers, are planned for future 
  expansion and are not active in Phase 1; however, the foundation is designed with them in 
  mind to ensure a smooth evolution as the platform grows. 
  
  Altogether, the system represents a holistic, privacy-conscious, security-aware personal 
  fitness companion, grounded in self-reported data and human-driven interaction, ready to 
  expand into sensor-based intelligence and richer technology layers when future phases begin.
