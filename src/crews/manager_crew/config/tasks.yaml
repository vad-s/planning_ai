    1. Read the raw 'Idea' provided.
    2. Translate this into a 'Project Brief' for Planners.
    3. Ensure the 'Project Brief' requires: 
       - Same API/DNA for all pillars.
       - Local LLM + Hybrid RAG (Local files + Internet search).
       - No hardware for now (put in Suggestion Pillar).
    4. Generate a 'Planner Task' that forces them to split pillars into 
       Small Doable Units (SDU) and find Local LLM/RAG fail points.
