vision_init_task:
  description: >
    1. Read the raw "Vision" provided.
    {vision}
    2. Translate this into a clear "Project Brief" intended for Planners.

      The "Project Brief" should include:
        - A concise summary of the system's purpose, scope, principles, and Phase 1 constraints.
        - Explicit instructions for planners to identify all major parts 
        implied by the Vision and describe each part with a name and short description.
  expected_output: >
    A YAML document containing:
      - project_brief: a concise planner-oriented summary of system purpose,
        scope, principles, and Phase 1 constraints
      - planner_instructions: explicit instruction for planners to identify
        all major parts implied by the Vision and describe each part with name and short description, except excludes features.
        But do not provide the list of parts, just instruct them to find it out by themselves based on the vision,
        and that they should provide a name ,description and another relevant details, if you decide to add.
      - planner_expected_outputs: a clear list of expected outputs from the planners, 
        such as a list of major parts with names ,descriptions and another relevant details in YAML format.

architect_briefing_task:
  description: >
    1. Read the raw 'Idea' provided.
    2. Translate this into a 'Project Brief' for Planners.
    3. Ensure the 'Project Brief' requires: 
       - Same API/DNA for all pillars.
       - Local LLM + Hybrid RAG (Local files + Internet search).
       - No hardware for now (put in Suggestion Pillar).
    4. Generate a 'Planner Task' that forces them to split pillars into 
       Small Doable Units (SDU) and find Local LLM/RAG fail points.
