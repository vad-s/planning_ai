 vision_init_task:
  description: |
    1. Read the raw "Vision" provided.
    {vision}
    2. Translate this into a clear "Project Brief" intended for Planners.

      The "Project Brief" should include:
        - A concise summary of the system's purpose, scope, principles, and Phase 1 constraints.
        - Explicit instructions for planners to identify all major zones (main parts) 
        implied by the Vision and describe each zone with a name and short description.
  expected_output: >
    A YAML document containing:
      - project_brief: a concise planner-oriented summary of system purpose,
        scope, principles, and Phase 1 constraints
      - planner_instructions: explicit instruction for planners to identify
        all major zones (main parts) implied by the Vision and describe each
        zone with name and short description, except excludes features.

architect_briefing_task:
  description: >
    1. Read the raw 'Idea' provided.
    2. Translate this into a 'Project Brief' for Planners.
    3. Ensure the 'Project Brief' requires: 
       - Same API/DNA for all pillars.
       - Local LLM + Hybrid RAG (Local files + Internet search).
       - No hardware for now (put in Suggestion Pillar).
    4. Generate a 'Planner Task' that forces them to split pillars into 
       Small Doable Units (SDU) and find Local LLM/RAG fail points.
