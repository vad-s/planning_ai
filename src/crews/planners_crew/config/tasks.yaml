  agent: creative_planner

create_balanced_plan:
  description: >
    Create a standard, industry-best-practice implementation plan for: {plan}.
    Use well-known libraries and established patterns.
  expected_output: >
    A balanced technical plan focusing on reliability and standard practices.
  agent: balanced_planner

create_conservative_plan:
  description: >
    Create a highly stable and risk-averse implementation plan for: {plan}.
    Stick to mature technologies and minimize complexity.
  expected_output: >
    A conservative technical plan focusing on stability and risk mitigation.
  agent: conservative_planner

create_final_plan:
  description: >
    Generate a final execution plan by coordinating three planning agents
    with similar scopes but different risk profiles. Each agent produces
    an independent plan. The conservative planner reviews, merges, and
    manages the final approved plan.

  expected_output: >
    A single, coherent final plan that balances ambition, feasibility,
    and risk control, with clear steps, timelines, and safeguards.
